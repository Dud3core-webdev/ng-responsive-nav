  "description": "This is a fully responsive navigation menu solution. It comes with a desktop navigation menu and collapses into a mobile burger menu. This library is for use with Angular 8 only, as I haven't tested it in older versions of Angular (or 9). It has minimal dependencies, no Bootstrap, just Angular, HTML, SCSS and the amazing [Font Awesome Angular Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/angular-fontawesome)",
